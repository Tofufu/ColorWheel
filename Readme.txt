This is a color wheel drawn using OpenCV's circle class.
Color wheel consists of 12 colors.
Written for Intel's RealSense Competition - CamVas!
Will be implemented into CamVas 3D Camera App so that users will be able to change their finger/mouse pen's to one of the selected colors.
In the actual app the white color will be dismissed (for now) until I make the pen less transparent.
